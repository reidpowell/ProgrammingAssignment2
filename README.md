# Document Summary
The sections of this document are intended to reflect the evaluation requirements.  There are two main sections to indicate how the submission meets the assignment's requirements (so that graders will (hopefully) feel able to answer "Yes").

1. Basic Requirements (First Evaluation Section)
  * valid GitHub URL containing a git repository
  * one commit beyond the original fork
  * SHA-1 indicating a specific commit in the GitHub repository
  * SHA-1 corresponds to a specific commit in the repository
2. Detailed Requirements (Second Evaluation Section, Overall Evaluation)
  * The R file contains code implementing the complete assignment
  * Both functions have corresponding explanatory comments in the R file
  * makeCacheMatrix: The solution appears to be correct and is written in a well-formatted and easily readable style
  * cacheSolve: The solution appears to be correct and is written in a well-formatted and easily readable style

# Basic Requirements
Here are the details to indicate the submission meets the assignment's basic requirements.

* https://github.com/reidpowell/ProgrammingAssignment2
* a658e33e111c39440f0d12e5c7acfa84db3b05c7

The above meets the assignment's requirement of

1. A valid GitHub URL containing a git repository. Please navigate to the repo by clicking the link.
2. One commit beyond the original fork. If you view the commits made to master by navigating to https://github.com/reidpowell/ProgrammingAssignment2/commits/master, several commits have been made since the initial fork: 266638b (https://github.com/reidpowell/ProgrammingAssignment2/commit/266638b28e4b7dbdccf1d6fa59ba60171e247ed4)
3. SHA-1 indicating a specific commit in the GitHub repository. The above is a 40-character SHA-1 value.
4. SHA-1 corresponds to a specific commit in the repository. To confirm that this corresponsds to a specific commit in the repo, please use that SHA-1 to navigate to the commit with https://github.com/reidpowell/ProgrammingAssignment2/commit/a658e33e111c39440f0d12e5c7acfa84db3b05c7

# Detailed Requirements
Below is a bit more detail about the submission beyond the minimum requirements listed above.

## R Code
Please navigate to https://github.com/reidpowell/ProgrammingAssignment2/blob/master/cachematrix.R to view the R code. It contains the two functions required:

1. "Special Matrix" constructor function, with getters and setters for the matrix and its inverse
2. An inverse calculation function that fetches the cached inverse and returns it if it exists, or calculates it otherwise.

## Explanatory Comments
The code is lightly commented throughout and assumes that the reader is familiar with the project.

## Function Correctness and Readability
The script test.R was used to check the correctness and timing of the functions. Whitespace and comments were used throughout to increase readability.

# Thank You!
Thank you, dear grader, for your time and comments!
